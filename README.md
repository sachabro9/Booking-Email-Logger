# Booking-Email-Logger
# Booking Email Automation Script

This Google Apps Script automates the processing of booking confirmation emails received from various sources (e.g., Airbnb, WeTravel, and BÃ³kun). It extracts essential booking information from each email, logs it into a Google Sheet, and creates an event in Google Calendar with the details.

## Features

- **Automated Email Processing**: Scans Gmail inbox for new booking confirmation emails labeled with a specified label.
- **Data Extraction**: Extracts key information including booking source, booking date, price, guest name, and contact information.
- **Google Sheets Logging**: Logs booking information in a Google Sheet for easy access and record-keeping.
- **Google Calendar Integration**: Creates a calendar event for each booking, detailing the booking source, guest name, contact information, and price.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- A Google account with access to Gmail, Google Sheets, and Google Calendar.
- Basic understanding of Google Apps Script.

### Setup Instructions

1. **Copy the Script**: Open Google Apps Script and create a new project. Copy the provided code into your Apps Script editor.

2. **Configuration**:
   - Replace `"YOUR_LABEL_NAME"` with the exact name of the Gmail label that contains the booking confirmation emails.
   - Replace `"YOUR_SHEET_NAME"` with the name of the Google Sheet where booking data will be logged.
   - Replace `"YOUR_CALENDAR_ID"` with your Google Calendar ID (found in your calendar settings under "Integrate calendar").

3. **OAuth Scopes**: Ensure the script requests appropriate permissions. These should be:
   - `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/gmail.readonly`
   - `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/spreadsheets`
   - `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/gmail.modify`
   - `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/calendar`

4. **Testing**: Run the `logBookingEmails` function manually to ensure it works as expected. Verify that:
   - Booking data appears in the specified Google Sheet.
   - Events are created in Google Calendar with the correct details.

### Automation

To automate this script, set up a time-driven trigger in Apps Script:
1. Go to **Triggers** in your Apps Script editor.
2. Add a new trigger for the `logBookingEmails` function.
3. Set the trigger to run at your preferred interval (e.g., daily or hourly).
